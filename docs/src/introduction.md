# Introduction

`midenup` is a tool created to facilitate the usage of various components that make up the miden ecosystem. It comes with two major utilities:
- `midenup`: used to install, update, manage and configure toolchains.
- `miden`: used to actually interact with the various components that make the installed toolchains up.

## Toolchains
The notion of a _toolchain_ here refers to the various components of the Miden project which are required in order to develop, test, run, and interact with Miden programs, both locally and on the network.

Currently, the set of such components consists of:

- The [Miden VM](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-vm/)
- The [Miden compiler](https://0xmiden.github.io/compiler/usage/midenc.html), `midenc`, and its [Rust tooling](https://0xmiden.github.io/compiler/usage/cargo-miden.html), i.e. `cargo-miden`
- The [Miden client](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-client/)
- The [Miden standard library](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-vm?tab=readme-ov-file#project-structure)
- The [Miden transaction kernel library](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-base?tab=readme-ov-file#project-structure)

In the future, more components will be added.
